# Aramancia Tracker

A D&D 5e character tracker PWA for tracking HP, AC, spell slots, and combat state with strict RAW (Rules as Written) compliance.

## Features

- **HP Management** - Current, Max, and Temporary HP with proper THP handling (THP absorbs damage first, doesn't stack)
- **AC Calculation** - Base AC with Mage Armor and Shield spell support (proper stacking rules)
- **Spell Slots** - Track usage across all spell levels with multiclass support
- **Concentration** - Single spell limit with automatic CON save DC calculation
- **Death Saves** - Track successes and failures
- **Minion Management** - Raise and track Skeletons and Zombies
- **Wild Shape** - Transform with carryover damage on revert
- **Attunement** - Max 3 items enforced
- **Rest System** - Short and Long rest automation

## V3.0 Architecture (New!)

The v3.0 paradigm introduces advanced state management with:

- ✨ **Normalized State** - Redux Toolkit with entity adapters for spells, effects, and actors
- 🔗 **Relational DAG** - Memoized selectors computing derived stats (spell DC, AC, HP, skill bonuses) with override support
- 🎯 **Decision-Node Spells** - Upcasting logic with scaling formulas and variant selection
- ⚡ **Event-Driven Concentration** - Automatic concentration checks triggered by damage events
- 🎨 **Reactive UI** - Components auto-update when base attributes change

See [V3.0 Architecture Documentation](docs/v3-architecture.md) for details.

## Morphic Programming System

This project uses a **Morphic System** for AI-assisted development. The system treats natural language as a high-level language and the AI as a compiler/runtime.

### Quick Start

When starting a new session with an AI agent (Cursor, Claude, etc.):

```
Read .agent/commands/prime.md and execute it for project aramancia
```

When ending a session:

```
Read .agent/commands/cleanup.md and execute it
```

### Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/prime-agent [project]` | Initialize session with context |
| `/cleanup` | Save progress, update logs |
| `/abstract [name] "[desc]"` | Create reusable command |
| `/build-feature "[name]"` | Standard feature workflow |
| `/test-feature "[name]"` | Standard testing workflow |

### Benefits

1. **Persistent Context** - State survives across sessions via markdown files
2. **Deterministic Behavior** - Preferences baked into `AGENT.md`, not repeated
3. **Recursive Learning** - Solved problems become reusable commands
4. **Audit Trail** - Work log provides continuity and accountability

## D&D 5e Rules Reference

This tracker implements strict SRD 5.1 compliance:

| Mechanic | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Temporary HP | Doesn't stack (choose higher), absorbs damage first |
| Mage Armor | Sets base to 13 + DEX (mutually exclusive with worn armor) |
| Shield Spell | +5 AC (stacks with base) |
| Concentration | One spell max, CON save DC = max(10, damage/2) |
| Attunement | Hard limit of 3 items |
| Death Saves | 3 successes = stabilize, 3 failures = death |
